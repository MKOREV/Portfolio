                            <p>My thesis was about geodiversity in the Netherlands. I used ArcGIS Pro to create a 3D model of the Netherlands and used the 3D analyst tool to calculate the geodiversity of the Netherlands. The geodiversity was calculated using the levels 3, 4 and 5 of the geodiversity model. The geodiversity model was created by the Dutch Geological Survey (TNO). The model is based on the geological composition of the Netherlands. The levels 3, 4 and 5 are the most detailed levels of the model
